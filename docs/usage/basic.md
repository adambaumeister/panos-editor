# Setup

Before you can get started using panos_editor, you need to install it.

You must have Python installed. This code is tested on Python **3.12**, so for best results
it's also the recommended version for running it.

It's recommended to use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install this application. Pipx is a cross-platform
tool for installing python scripts into your system path.

Assuming you have both Python and Pipx installed, you can get this application with the following
command:

```shell
pipx install panos_editor
```
